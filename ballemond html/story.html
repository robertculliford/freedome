           <p>Bellamont houses the rejects of mainstream society. It is a hidden community, in an abandoned neon junkyard, that lives in perennial night-time. There are two groups of people who roam the streets of Bellamont: outsiders and citizens. Outsiders can only access Bellamont if they find one of the portals hidden around the 5 cities (Milan, London, Shanghai, New York and Melbourne). Their permanence is granted only for as long as it is night in their city too, once the sun rises they have to leave. Only the right kind of people can be citizens of Bellamont: they must be outcasts and feel limited by laws of modern society but above all they must be chosen by Lenny, the community’s spiritual guide. Lenny is a luminous goat, venerated by the community. However Bellamont is self governed. There are no rules except 1: do not take off the mask you are assigned once let in, to ensure anonymity, especially when outsiders are involved. </p>

The family has had a good reputation for hundreds of years because of their famous production of gloves in history.Ever since Kiddely was a child she was pressured by her mother and constrained to pretend a perfect life. She felt tight to the point that she developed kleptomania. Her mother payed people off instead of understanding and taking care of Kidd. Kidd found a box full of gloves which allow her to control the disease. As soon as she finished the University her mother decided to send her away from home where nobody could link her to the Captain family. In the new place Kidd felt lonely except when she climbed on trees during the night to see the lights of the closer city. Once she noticed something wired: neon footprint and she decided to follow them ending in Bellamont.</p>

Luckily Bucket is there and puts her mask back on and takes her to Ireland’s pub for a drink. He tells her about the legend that whoever has taken their mask of disappeared and warns her not to. Suspicious about this, Kidd decides to investigate. <span class="charactername">Culliford</span>, the bartender, overhears them and tells Kidd about his crazy boss <span class="charactername">Ireland</span>, who had a similar experience. Kidd talks to Ireland and discovers he has gone crazy as a consequence of taking his mask off. Not being able to entertain reasonable conversations, he gives her a cryptic clue about how to find out more about the mask. She understands that something is wrong and decides to investigate further. The only thing that it is clear to her is that she has to follow Lenny. Lenny appears and Kidd follows him.</p>

            <p class="mb-5"><h5>Chapter 4:</h5><h2><img src="img/thedarkness.png" alt=""></h2>Lenny leads Kidd to the hidden headquarters of Bellamont. There she finds out that the community is nothing like everyone expected. The utopian, rule-free, paradise is actually a prison. The masks magically absorb the citizens’ bad thoughts related to their rough pasts, making them happy and guilt-free, and aliments a darkness generator, which ensures the everlasting night-time. This means that when removed, they cause irreversible breakdowns. The architect of all of this is <span class="charactername">Donna Bellamont</span>, whose intentions she finds out about in a promotional video (aimed at the world’s richest businessmen) stored in the headquarters. The video explains that she built a self-ruled prison that criminals voluntarily access and that will, ultimately purify the world from evil. Whilst there, she is suddenly chased by <span class="charactername">Q</span>, the keeper of the headquarters, who is in charge of executing any dissident and is also responsible of the disappearance of those who have taken off their masks in the past. Kidd saves herself because Ireland appears and fights Q to death.</p>

            <p class="mb-5"><h5>Chapter 5:</h5><h2><img src="img/thechoice.png" alt=""></h2>Kidd is reminded that her week probation is almost over and understands that permanent citizenship is correlated the the effects of the mask. She discovers that she has a couple of hours left before being imprisoned forever and has to make a choice. Should she leave and save herself or stay and try to save all of the citizens by organising a rebellion? If she chooses to leave she will disappoint Lenny whose plan was to destroy Bellamont and be freed from Donna. If she stays she will have to work hard to convince all of the citizens of what she has learned and organise an underground rebellion. He also tells those who decide to stay that the only way to free themselves is to remove all of the masks at the same time, causing the darkness dome to crumble and Donna to lose her powers. Either way, Lenny will explain that he has served Donna as slave and has overlooked Bellamont from her throughout the years. His symbiosis with her started as a punishment from his past life as a mischievous god. He has been trying to separate himself for years and planned to do so with the help of Kidd. Lenny shows that all of the turning points in the story (Kidd joining the community, Oliver’s message and the conversation with Ireland) are part of his plan.</p>
